# Timed Auction Article By Utibe Etuk For The Decentralized Umoja 3 Bounty Hack

This is the article for my umoja 3 bounty hack, for this hackathon I decided to develop a timed nft auction dapp where participants in this auction are  allowed to make their bids as long  as it is within the time constraint i.e as long as the time is not up, once it times out the highest bidder wins the nft. 


Unluckily enough for me I got into this hackathon 4 weeks late already and  I dedicated the remaining 2 weeks to completing my project which I am so  glad I  was able to. These past days were hell for  me and my resilent mentor who was always there to answer my noob questions but if not for my  dedication and my never giving up mentality I was able to beat all the errors and cross the finish line.

My Dapp has a ton of feautures most remarkably the functions allocated  to the deployer(Auctioner), the auctioner can choose the nft  image, choose a name of his/her choice, set the minimum bid and can start the auction also being able to see the participants  of the  auction and  their  bids. On the participants side they are being prompted to select a bid which must be greater than the minimun  bid and once the timer is up the highest bid wins the bid and everyone including the auctioner  sees that.

At the start of the hack I was thinking to  myself  "how  do you want to pull this off", so I started some intense research, I went through the tutorials, went through the documentations, browsed through the resources I could lay my hands on and I put on my developer hat and went days staright on my screen with less than 5 hours screen off time a day just to cross the finish line.

Most problems I had while developing my project I either solved them myself or I relayed them to my mentor and he helped me out every single time I hit a roadblock.

I faced a lot of errors while trying to manipulate the features of an API in reach, I was also having some problems when it came to the invariant for my while loop in my parralel reduce, that alone gave me a lot of errors, I can not count the number of times I was ready to close my laptop and give up but I put my head down went back to the whiteboard and debugged all the errors.

Developing time using reach was a whole lot faster as soon as I understood how it all comes together compared to Solidity and other competitors, apart from that the cost for deploying my smart contracts was really small, making it cheaper,faster, easier and more secure to create decentralized applications using Reach.

If I got into the hack as early as everyone else I would have had more time to add some additional features to my project like adding a visible timer and also making an eth version of my project and most importantly a vibrant user interface. 

I am grateful to the Reach platform for organizing this bounty hack not just any bounty hack but one for we Africans. During the course of the hackathon, I gained a lot experience along the way, the challenges and errors I faced while debugging and getting my application to be as functional as expected has helped me develop a lot as a full-stack developer and as a blockchain developer. I would totally recommend this experience to anybody developer or not, getting to fully understand Reach was really fun and not so demanding although it wasnâ€™t easy but thanks to the documentations, the discord community and my extraordinary mentor I was able to come out triumphant.
